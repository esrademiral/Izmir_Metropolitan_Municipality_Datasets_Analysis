# In my research project, I used "energy consumption per passenger, CO2 emission value and number of trips" dataset from IBB portal. 
# First let's take a look at what my data means:  # CO2 emission value: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a colorless, odorless and non-poisonous gas formed by combustion of carbon and in the respiration of living organisms and is considered a greenhouse gas. This value can be reduced by using public transport.  
# Energy consumption per passenger: It is the total energy consumption per passenger (kWh) of metro and tram transportation. 
# Number of trips realized: It is the information about the number of trips realized. (Number of trips planned - number of trips not departed).
